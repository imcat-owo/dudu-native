/// [第20条 · 快照半边] Automatic on-device snapshots: the safety net
/// between manual backups.
///
/// A manual backup only exists when the user remembers to make one, so
/// the failure this guards against is "the data broke / the phone was
/// reset, and the newest package is weeks old". The app therefore takes
/// a snapshot by itself — a full package built by the SAME
/// `BackupExporter` a manual run uses, so there is exactly one packaging
/// implementation to trust — and keeps it in the same delivered-packages
/// folder, renamed with a `snapshot-` prefix. The existing restore flow
/// picks `.dudubak` files from Files, and the Backups folder is visible
/// there, so a snapshot is restorable with no new UI; snapshot runs also
/// appear in Backup History like any other run, first log line
/// "Automatic snapshot".
///
/// Deliberate scope limits (the other half of 第20条 — importing OTHER
/// apps' backups — is not built):
///   * On-device only. Nothing is uploaded anywhere; destinations and
///     delivery are the manual flow's job.
///   * Credentials are NOT included. A snapshot is an unencrypted
///     package sitting in user-visible storage; the manual flow only
///     ships secrets inside an encrypted package, and a same-device
///     restore keeps the Keychain anyway.
///   * No settings UI. Whether a toggle should exist is a product
///     decision, not made here.
/// [P3-10] That decision is now made: Backup settings has an Automatic
/// Snapshots switch (default ON) plus the current storage footprint, and
/// the switch gates both triggers in `scheduleCheck` below.
///
/// Triggering follows the Kelivo snapshot shape: shortly after launch
/// (≈8s) and after returning to the foreground (≈3s) the service checks
/// whether the newest snapshot is still fresh; if not, it takes one.
/// The required freshness interval grows with the size of the last
/// snapshot (bigger data → rarer snapshots), so a large install doesn't
/// pay a full export every day.
